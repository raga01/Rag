check VM schedule first : 
==========================
q eve * * begind=-1 endd=today n=*_VM* f=d

*check whether all the previous day 7 schedules are in completed status. Current day 7 schedules will be in future state. 
*If completed go to "q se" clear if any stale sessions for VM ( Mostly there won't be any stale sessions ) 
*If any failed/missed/inprogress/started login to that particular VM and kill the service and restart the service. 

*If there are more failures (do snapshot validation first) 
*Snapshot validation - daily basis, snapshot consolidation - Mon, wed, Fri (Kindly refer my mails to APMM backup team)

To login into VDM(VBS):
=======================

pwd: 

sudo su -
pwd:

Check the service:
=====================
"ps-ef | grep dsm"
* To check the sched log "tail -n5000 /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsmsched_dm.log"
* DSMC "dsmc -asnode=IWPVVC01_VM_DC_BAL -se=ILPVDM06_DM"  (just change the VDM number from 1 to 6 )
* To start the service " nohup /usr/bin/dsmc sched -se=ILPVDM06_DM &"  (change the vdm number from 1 to 6)
* To trigger the backup "backup vm <vm name>"  (Don't trigger more than 10 in one VDM at a time). 

Command to pull the dump from IAPBUR007 in -comma mode 
=======================================================
select start_time,end_time,schedule_name,sub_entity,successful from summary_extended where activity_details='VMware' and start_time between '2021-11-24 17:30:00' and '2021-11-25 17:30:00'
(change the date alone) 

* copy the VE report from previous day and change the date
* Copy the dump manually and paste it in the VE report 
* Clear the blank lines (for every 50 lines 2 rows will be blank- clear all ) 
* Goto VE report and insert a line, update the date 
* Do the vlookup (=VLOOKUP(A2,'24-Nov'!D:E,2,0))
* select No and N/A.. update the reason as per previous days output 
* Find out the actual failure and trigger the failed/missed backup. 

* Goto Office 365 mail , everyday around 9.31 AM IST , you will receive a mail from Wintel with the title "[EXTERNAL] Powered On VMs on Cluster 4"
* Copy all the listed VM and paste it in VM from Wintel sheet (clear the previous data in the same  sheet and paste the new data everyday from mail)
* While pasting use right click ---> unicode text (delete the 1st line with *) 

* Apply filter from Data --> filter 
* Drop down VM without SQL, In that in search - type SQL and select all the SQL nodes (we do not take VM backup for SQL nodes ) and delete those sql nodes. 
* For the remaining nodes we need to apply vlookup with VM Report in the backup status (=VLOOKUP(A2,'VE Report'!A:C,3,0))

* Goto moved to inhost sheet. Do one more vlookup in the "VM from Wintel" (=VLOOKUP(A2,'Inhost backup Sheet '!A:B,2,0)) 
* Apply Filter - mark inhost as inhost. In the drop down check for any N/A, If there is any N/A, that is a new node and we need to check with Wintel team whether we need to add them 
into snapshot backup (As of now two nodes - IWTSCT01 & IWPFIQ01 are in N/A and wintel team updated that backup not required for these nodes now). 

* Anil D is the SME, Krishnakumar M, Sundar K, Unnikrishnan Narayanan are few from Wintel.. check with any one and they will help you 
* If they suggest for VM backup add the node to the VM report above DECOM node and add it to sys file of VDM's as per count 

* In the VM dashboard you can find out column L and M for VDM and active VM count.
